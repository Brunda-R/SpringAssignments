The @font-face rule is used to exhaustively describe a font face for use in a document. @font-face may also be used to define the location of a font for download, although this may run into implementation-specific limits.

In general, @font-face is extremely complicated, and its use is not recommended for any except those who are expert in font metrics.

Here is an example -

<style tyle="text/css">
   <!--
   @font-face {
      font-family: "Scarborough Light";
      src: url("http://www.font.site/s/scarbo-lt");
   }
   @font-face {
      font-family: Santiago;
      src: local ("Santiago"),
      url("http://www.font.site/s/santiago.tt")
      format("truetype");
      unicode-range: U+??,U+100-220;
      font-size: all;
      font-family: sans-serif;
   }
   -->
</style>

If you are writing your document using a character set other than ASCII or ISO-8859-1 you might want to set the @charset rule at the top of your style sheet to indicate what character set the style sheet is written in.

The @charset rule must be written right at the beginning of the style sheet without even a space before it. The value is held in quotes and should be one of the standard character-sets. For example -

<style tyle="text/css">
   <!--
   @charset "iso-8859-1"
   .......other CSS rules .....
   -->
</style>

The @import rule allows you to import styles from another style sheet. It should appear right at the start of the style sheet before any of the rules, and its value is a URL.

It can be written in one of the two following ways -

<style tyle="text/css">
   <!--
   @import "mystyle.css";
   or
   @import url("mystyle.css");
   .......other CSS rules .....
   -->
</style>
The significance of the @import rule is that it allows you to develop your style sheets with a modular approach. You can create various style sheets and then include them wherever you need them.

The @import: rule imports another style sheet into the current style sheet.
The @charset rule indicates the character set the style sheet uses.
The @font-face rule is used to exhaustively describe a font face for use in a document.
The !important rule indicates that a user-defined rule should take precedence over the author's style sheets.
