1. What is Spring Boot? Why should you use it?
A. Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that one can just run.
   One can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.
   We can use Spring Boot because of these following reasons.	
	a. It provides a flexible way to configure Java Beans, XML configurations, and Database Transactions.
	b. It provides a powerful batch processing and manages REST endpoints.
	c. In Spring Boot, everything is auto configured; no manual configurations are needed.
	d. It offers annotation-based spring application
	e. Eases dependency management
	f. It includes Embedded Servlet Container

2.What is the difference between @SpringBootApplication and @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation?
A.  @SpringBootApplication is the entry point of the spring boot application to start. 
    It internally bundles 3 annotations -
	a. @EnableAutoCoinfiguration
	b. @ComponentScan
	c. @SpringBootConfiguration
   where as the clear purpose of @EnableAutoConfiguration is to enable automatic configuration feature of Spring Boot application which automatically configures things if certain classes are present in Classpath

3.What is Spring Initializer? why should you use it?
A. One of the ways to Bootstrapping a Spring Boot application is by using Spring Initializer.
   To do this, you will have to visit the Spring Initializer web page www.start.spring.io and choose your Build, Spring Boot Version and platform. 
   Also, you need to provide a Group, Artifact and required dependencies to run the application.
   we can use it because it generates configuration file with dependencies mentioned, without making user write boilerplate codes. 

4. What is Spring Boot CLI? What are its benefits?
A. The Spring Boot CLI is a Command Line Interface for Spring Boot. It can be used for a quick start with Spring. 
   It can run Groovy scripts which means that a developer need not write boilerplate code; all that is needed is focus on business logic. 
   Spring Boot CLI is the fastest way to create a Spring-based application.
   	Benefits
	a. It provides an interface to run and test Spring Boot Application from command prompt.
	b. It internally use Spring Boot Starter and Spring Boot AutoConfigurate components in order to resolve all dependencies and executes the application.
	c. It contains Groovy compiler and Grape Dependency Manager.
	d. It supports Groovy Scripts without external Groovy installation.
	e. It adds Spring Boot defaults and resolve all dependencies automatically.

5. Can you change the port of Embedded Tomcat server in Spring boot? If Yes, How?
A yes, the port of Embedded Tomcat server in Spring boot can be changed from default 8080 to required.
  Generate a property file named "application.properties" and include "server.port=<portno>"
