What is Loose Coupling?
A. In computing and systems design a loosely coupled system is one in which each of its components has, or makes use of,
little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components.
Subareas include the coupling of classes, interfaces, data, and services. Loose coupling is the opposite of tight coupling.

What is a Dependency?
A. A Java class has a dependency on another class, if it uses an instance of this class. We call this a class dependency.
For example, a class which accesses a logger service has a dependency on this service class.

What is IOC (Inversion of Control)?
A. Inversion of Control (IoC) is an object-oriented programing practice whereby the object coupling is bounded at runtime
 by an "assembler" object and are typically not knowable at compile time using static analysis.

What is Dependency Injection?
A. Dependency injection (DI) is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.
Ideally Java classes should be as independent as possible from other Java classes.
This increases the possibility of reusing these classes and to be able to test them independently from other classes.

Can you give few examples of Dependency Injection?
A. Ex: Using bean factory
Resource resource=new ClassPathResource("applicationContext.xml");  
BeanFactory factory=new XmlBeanFactory(resource);  

What is Auto Wiring?
A. Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or
 constructor injection. Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values.

What are the important roles of an IOC Container?
A.  The main tasks performed by IoC container are:
	to instantiate the application class
	to configure the object
	to assemble the dependencies between the objects

What are Bean Factory and Application Context?
A. These are 2 IOC Containers used in Spring for Dependency Injection.

Can you compare Bean Factory with Application Context?
A. The org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory and the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interfaces acts as the
IoC container. The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface. It adds some extra functionality
than BeanFactory such as simple integration with Spring's AOP, message resource handling (for I18N), event propagation, 
application layer specific context (e.g. WebApplicationContext) for web application. So it is better to use ApplicationContext
than BeanFactory.

How do you create an application context with Spring?
A. ApplicationContext context =   
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");  

How does Spring know where to search for Components or Beans?
A. This part of “telling Spring where to search” is called a Component Scan. You define the packages that have to be scanned.
 Once you define a Component Scan for a package, Spring would search the package and all its sub packages for components/beans.

What is a Component Scan?
A. Using component scan is one method of asking Spring to detect Spring-managed components. Spring needs the information to 
locate and register all the Spring components with the application context when the application starts. Spring can auto scan,
detect, and instantiate components from pre-defined project packages.

How do you define a component scan in XML and Java Configurations?
A. Annotation @ComponentScan can be used in java files.
  <context:component-scan> can be used in XML configuration.

How is it done with Spring Boot?
A. @ComponentScan can be used.

What does @Component signify?
A. @Component is the most generic Spring annotation. A Java class decorated with @Component is found during classpath scanning
 and registered in the context as a Spring bean.

What does @Autowired signify?
A. Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or
 constructor injection. Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values.
